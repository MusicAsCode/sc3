Contributing to the documentation
=================================

The documentation of this project is largely base on SuperCollider's
help files. However I've added and modified some things to explain or
make concepts more clear, at least as I see it. You are very welcome
to contribute if you find mistakes, no so well defined concept or want
to make improvements overall.

Note about docstrings
---------------------

Inline docstrings are used as a succinct reference for the builtin
pydoc help system. They are not the final documentation but a start point
(initial API documentation is generated from them).
They may contain implementation details or explanations that are not
suitable for the main documentation, although they may be important.
Also, they should not be occluded by markups.
